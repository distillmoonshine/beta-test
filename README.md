# Moonshine 2 Beta Test
You're cool as shit and have been selected to beta test the latest version of moonshine.

It would be amazing if you used Moonshine to edit a video of your own. Test out all the features and especially the ones that interest you. Do your best to break it.

## Logistical stuff
### How do I access the beta?
Nothing! If you have access to this page, you should get the beta page by default when you log in.

If you don't have an account, go sign up at [usemoonshine.com](https://usemoonshine.com).

When you make your first project and log in make sure the project url starts with ```beta.usemoonshine.com/edit?...```. If you see```editor.usemoonshine.com/edit?...``` just change it to beta.

### How do I give my feedback?
Just message one of us privately or you can publicly roast us on our [discord](https://discord.gg/aCgjDqbJNr).

### What kind of feedback do y'all want?
First and foremost, your thoughts on the user interface and user experience of Moonshine. If something didn't make sense at first glance or took you a second to process, note that down.

If something breaks (you get an error page or the product just hangs) let us know. Screenshots of the console log would also really help (Right click on the page and select inspect element -> console).

## Getting Started with Moonshine
We're in the process of making a robust and interactive guide to Moonshine, but this page will have to suffice for now. Here are the basics.

### Uploading content
To upload your content, you can drag your files anywhere into Moonshine.

To click to upload files, click the Files toggle at the bottom right of the screen, and then the uploads button at the top of the menu. You can now click here to upload your files. In this menu, you can also upload from your phone. Click the upload from your phone pill button and scan the QR code with your phone. You can start uploading files from your phone. Make sure that your phone stays on the entire time during the upload process.

### Using create
By default, Moonshine will open into create mode. Create allows you to describe anything in the search bar and Moonshine will build it for you (think chatGPT for your videos). Create has an understanding of all of your uploads, and the items currently on your timeline.

Possible things to type in can be:
- "Make me a 30 second video showing my dinner"
- "Make me a 5 min video of us making pasta and then eating it"
- "Add eating my food to this video"

### Quick adds and searching
When in the search bar at the bottom of the timeline you can use the up and down arrow keys to toggle between modes or the dropdown menu on the far left. Let's switch into search.

Search allows you type anything and find your needle in a haystack from all your footage. You can search for anything you have seen said or did.

Possible searches can be:
- "A blue box"
- "Pouring sauce into a pan"
- "When I said today, we are making yummy yummy pasta"
- "A balloon with the words happy birthday on it"

Below the search bar are quick adds which are a few recommended searches to build your video. Just click on these to add them directly to your timeline.

### Exporting
To export your video click the export button at the bottom middle of the editor. This will open up the export settings menu. You can set the file format to export to and then click the start export button to start exporting your video.

The right hand side of the export menu shows you your previous exports of the project.

## Moonshine's extras
These are the extra features Moonshine has: cool shit and quality of life stuff

### Adding media to the timeline
You can directly add videos to the timeline. Click the files toggle at the bottom right of the editor and select the images, videos, or audio tab to select your media.

Single clicking items here will open the items in preview mode where you can view the media but it has not been added to your timeline.

To add the media to your timeline. Double click the media in the file browser, hit enter, or click the add button in the notification at the top of your screen.

Media will add at the playhead (the white line across the timeline)

### Adding text
To add text to the timeline, click the text icon at the bottom center of the editor (left of the export button) or click the t key on your keyboard.

### Modifying timeline element properties
To modify any timeline element's properties, click on it and its properties will appear the bottom of the timeline.

### Tracking
Tracking allows you to pin any image onto a video. In the scene, simple click the pin button at the top of the top of the image on top of a video and give it a few mins to process.

### Smart Snap
If you want to sync your video to a beat you can enable smart snapping. Select an audio track and open its properties where you can click enable in the smart snap dropdown which will show some more settings.

The settings control how fast or slow you want your video to feel (how far apart the snap points are).

You can now snap other elements to the beat of the song into the timeline.
