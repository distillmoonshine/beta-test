# Moonshine 2 Beta Test
You're cool as shit and have been selected to beta test the latest version of moonshine. The firt version of Moonshine was cool, but we've been working to make it even better and we need your feedback.

## Logistical stuff
### How do I access the beta?
Nothing! If you have access to this page, you should get the beta page by default when you log in.

If you don't have an account, go sign up at [usemoonshine.com](https://usemoonshine.com).

When you make your first project and log in make sure the project url starts with ```beta.usemoonshine.com/edit?...```. If you see```editor.usemoonshine.com/edit?...``` just change it to beta.

### How do I give my feedback?
Just message Ganesh or Harsha or you can publically roast us on this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-SFscAKYW0VygGqI6Pkjy1iyU1q0613kGRUgtmLV30/edit?tab=t.0).
