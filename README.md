# Moonshine 2 Beta Test
You're cool as shit and have been selected to beta test the latest version of moonshine.

It would be amazing if you used Moonshine to edit a video of your own. Test out all the featres and especially the ones that interest you. Do your best to break it.

## Logistical stuff
### How do I access the beta?
Nothing! If you have access to this page, you should get the beta page by default when you log in.

If you don't have an account, go sign up at [usemoonshine.com](https://usemoonshine.com).

When you make your first project and log in make sure the project url starts with ```beta.usemoonshine.com/edit?...```. If you see```editor.usemoonshine.com/edit?...``` just change it to beta.

### How do I give my feedback?
Just message one of us or you can publically roast us on this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-SFscAKYW0VygGqI6Pkjy1iyU1q0613kGRUgtmLV30/edit?tab=t.0).

### What kind of feedback do y'all want?
First and foremost, your thoughts on the user interface and user expereince of Moonshine. If something didn't make sense at first glance or took you a second to process, note that down.

If something breaks (you get an error page or the product just hangs) let us know. Screenshots of the console log would also really help (Right click on the page and select inspect element -> console).

## Getting Started with Moonshine
We're in the process of making a robust and interactive guide to Moonshine, but this page will have to suffice for now. Here are the basics.

### Uploading content
To uplaod your content, you can drag your files anywhere into Moonshine.
To click to upload files, click the Files toggle at the bottom right of the screen, and then the uploads button at the top of the menu. You can now click here to upload your files.
In this menu, you can also upload from your phone. Click the upload from your phone pill button and scan the QR code with your phone. You can start uploading files from your phone. Make sure that your phone stays on the entire time during the upload process.

### Using create
By default, Moonshine will open into create mode. Create allows you to describe anything in the searchbar and Moonshine will build it for you (think chatgpt for your videos). Create has an understanding of all of your uploads, and the items currently on your timeline.
Possible things to type in can be:
- "Make me a 30 second video showing my dinner"
- "Make me a 5 min video of us making pasta and then eating it"
- "Add"
